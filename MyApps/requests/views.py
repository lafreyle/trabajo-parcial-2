Imports:
The imports at the top include necessary modules from Django and Django REST Framework.
HttpResponse is used to return simple HTTP responses, while Http404 can be raised to indicate that a resource was not found.
Response is used to return DRF responses, and generics provides class-based views for common patterns.
The LoanApplication model and its serializer are imported for use in the views.

Home View:
The home function is a simple view that returns a welcome message. It uses HttpResponse to send a plain text response.
You might consider using a template for rendering a more complex home page in the future.

LoanApplicationList View:
This class-based view inherits from generics.ListCreateAPIView, which provides functionality to list all loan applications and create a new one.
queryset: This defines the set of loan applications that will be retrieved from the database.
serializer_class: This specifies the serializer that will be used to convert the loan application instances to JSON format.

LoanApplicationDetail View:
This class-based view inherits from generics.RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView, which provides functionality to retrieve, update, or delete a loan application based on its primary key (pk).
Similar to the LoanApplicationList view, it defines the queryset and serializer_class.
